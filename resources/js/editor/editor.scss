/// Core WP sets this to `max-height: 150px`, which basically renders filters on
/// `editor.PostFeaturedImage.imageSize` hook useless because custom sizes do
/// not appear correctly.
///
.editor-post-featured-image__preview {
	max-height: none;
}

/// Ensure the the color picker respects the color scheme.

.components-circular-option-picker__option {
	color-scheme: light dark;
