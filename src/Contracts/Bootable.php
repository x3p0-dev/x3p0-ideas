 * Bootable interface.

 * Defines the contract that bootable classes should utilize. Bootable classes
 * should have a `boot()` method with the singular purpose of "booting" any
 * necessary code that needs to run. Most bootable classes are meant to be
 * single-instance classes that get loaded once per page request.
