## Theme Review Guidelines

This theme is developed with the WordPress.org [theme review guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review) in mind. All new features and code changes must abide by these guidelines to make it into the project.

## Coding Standards

The project follows a mixture of the following standards.

- [PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1)
- [PSR-2: Coding Style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)

- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards)

There are instances where I opt for personal choices of my own. In terms of contributing, stick to the standard you're most familiar with or fall back to the WordPress coding standards. I'll make any adjustments later if the need arises.
