 * Theme Name:        X3P0: Ideas
 * Theme URI:         https://github.com/x3p0-dev/x3p0-ideas
 * Description:       Beautiful...Bold...[Insert adjective to sell you on using this theme]. Oh, never mind all that. I could try to sway you with two-dollar words and fancy dreams, but I'll just shoot straight from the hip. So, here goes. All the ideas I have. In a theme. Literally every idea. No concept is so outlandish that I won't try to wiggle it in one way or another. Except sidebars. Sidebars were so 2010. OK. Maybe I'll add them one day. But com'on—give your content some space to do its thing. Let it be the star of the show. Bells and whistles are for people less interesting than you.
