 * Theme URI:         https://github.com/x3p0-dev/x3p0-ideas
 * Description:       Beautiful...Bold...[Insert adjective to sell you on using this theme]. Oh, never mind all that. I could try to sway you with two-dollar words and fancy dreams, but I'll just shoot straight from the hip. So, here goes. All the ideas I have. In a theme. Literally every idea. No concept is so outlandish that I won't try to wiggle it in one way or another. Except sidebars. Sidebars were so 2010. OK. Maybe I'll add them one day. But com'onâ€”give your content some space to do its thing. Let it be the star of the show. Bells and whistles are for people less interesting than you.
